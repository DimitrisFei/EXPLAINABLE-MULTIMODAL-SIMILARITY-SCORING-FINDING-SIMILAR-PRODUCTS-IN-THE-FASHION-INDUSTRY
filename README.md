# EXPLAINABLE-MULTIMODAL-SIMILARITY-SCORING-FINDING-SIMILAR-PRODUCTS-IN-THE-FASHION-INDUSTRY
# Abstract

The rapid expansion of big data and advancements in artificial intelligence have amplified the need for comprehensive information processing frameworks capable of handling multiple data modalities, including visual, textual, and numerical data. In this study, we propose an innovative, explainable multimodal similarity scoring system designed to integrate and analyze diverse data types effectively. The proposed framework is exemplified within the fashion industry, where product similarity evaluations rely on both visual features and detailed textual descriptions, demonstrating the systemâ€™s applicability and potential impact.

Our approach leverages cutting-edge deep learning architectures for image analysis, transformer-based models for text processing, and advanced color space computations. The multimodal integration is achieved through a weighted strategy that ensures equitable contributions from each data type, resulting in accurate and comprehensive similarity assessments. To enhance the transparency of AI-driven decisions, we incorporate Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, including Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), providing clear and actionable insights into the decision-making process.

A thorough evaluation, conducted with feedback from domain experts, measures both the performance of the multimodal approach and the interpretability of the explanations provided. This work advances the field of explainable AI by presenting a framework that strikes a balance between high accuracy and interpretability, offering valuable insights for industries that depend on reliable multimodal data processing solutions.
